# DSP539_Final Project Report

A dataset titled **“Medical Cost Personal Dataset”** was used in this study. It contained seven different variables: age, sex, BMI, (number of) children, smoker (yes or no), region (in the US), and charges (USD).  

**Motivating Data:** Purpose is to analyze correlation between cost and specific variables in the dataset. This analysis is valued by health insurance companies to determine risk and set premiums. 

**Data Analysis:** Calculated Pearson correlation coefficients to determine variables with correlation to cost. Analysis was performed on all variables. Age, BMI (only for smokers), and smoking status were shown to be direct predictors of cost. The other variables demonstrated no significant correlation.

**Model:** Multiple linear regression and polynomial regression were used as the models.  

**Discussion:** Increase in age is directly correlated with increase in cost as well as increase in BMI (only for smokers and specifically at around 30 BMI). Smokers were associated with much higher medical costs compared to those who do not smoke, across all variables.
